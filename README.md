# EasyNotepad

This is a simple note-taking app for Android written in Kotlin.

Basic functionality, but with room with more features eventually. The code could benefit from some updating.

## Update - Jun 2021
I've learned much since haphazardly gluing this app together with scant Android knowledge, so I'm rewriting all of it to make use of MVVM architecture and look much nicer.
